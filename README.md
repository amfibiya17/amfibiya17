I am a Software Engineer and recent graduate of the highly selective programming bootcamp [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/).

I have BA in Mathematics with Management and background in finances and logistics, which I have worked for the past 5 years.

As a graduate of the Makers Academy, I now have the skills to build, full stack applications using JavaScript and Ruby. I am trained in OOP, TDD, pair programming and using agile processes.

During my time at Makers, I have fallen in love with coding and am excited to bring my passion and enthusiasm to a new role.
